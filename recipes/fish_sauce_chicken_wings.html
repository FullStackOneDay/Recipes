		<p>Create the perfect Fish Sauce Chicken Wings with these steps</p>
		<h3>Ingredients</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>8 garlic cloves</li>
			<li>⅛ teaspoon salt</li>
			<li>¼ cup warm water</li>
			<li>¼-½ cup fish sauce </li>
			<li>½ cup superfine sugar</li>
			<li>1½ pounds chicken wings</li>
			<li>⅔ cup rice flour</li>
			<li>2 tablespoons cornstarch</li>
			<li>¼ cup water</li>
			<li>1-2 teaspoons Thai chili paste</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Steps</h3>
		<p>Notes: Makes 2 dozen wings.</p>
		<ol>
			<li><strong>Make the marinade.</strong> Mince the garlic with the salt. We used a garlic press and mixed the salt in. Add the warm water and let sit for 10 minutes. Add the fish sauce and sugar, stirring to dissolve.</li>
			<li><strong>Marinate the wings.</strong> Place the chicken wings in a separate large bowl with ½ cup of the fish sauce mixture and toss. Marinate for 4 hours or overnight, setting aside the rest of the fish sauce mixture in the refrigerator.</li>
			<li><strong>Mix with batter.</strong> When the wings are done marinating, transfer to a colander, and let drain for 15 minutes. Mix the rice flour and cornstarch together, and toss the wings in the dry mixture until coated.</li>
			<li><strong>Bake the wings.</strong> Bake the wings at 475 degrees for 24 minutes, flipping halfway through. Halfway through the cooking time, start to make the glaze.</li>
			<li><strong>Add the sauce.</strong> Add ¼ cup of water to the reserved fish sauce mixture and transfer to a hot wok. Add the chili paste. Bring to a boil in a wok, and reduce for 1-2 minutes. Add the wings and toss to coat them in the glaze, about 1 minute.</li>
			<li><strong>Enjoy.</strong> Serve with some refreshing sliced cucumbers on the side!</li>
